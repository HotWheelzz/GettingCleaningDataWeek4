Dataset:Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files
-CodeBook.md: Describes what the code does by explaining the data given and the steps taken to transform to a Tidy Data set by cleaning it.


-run_analysis.md: is the code used to to prepare and generate the outs put required by the class. Below are the five tips that we were required to complete.

1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



-NewCleanData.txt: is the greeted file described in step 5 from the requirements.
